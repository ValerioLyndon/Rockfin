# Rockfin

This project is in an **unreleased** state. Expect bugs and bare minimum QC for commits until it's more feature complete.

## Installation

Currently, all the recommended or "core" CSS is combined into the ["recommended.css"](recommended.css) file in this directory. You can copy-paste that entire file into your Jellyfin CSS box. See how to do that [here](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/clients/css-customization/).

## Gallery

These screenshots display designs that may have already changed or be subject to change later.
